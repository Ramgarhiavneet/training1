<h3><i>Hi, I'm Avneet Singh, a 18-year-old Computer Science Engineering student at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC), Ludhiana. Born and raised in Ludhiana, I've always been fascinated by the power of technology and how it continues to shape the world around us.

Currently in the process of completing my B.Tech degree, I'm passionate about programming, problem-solving, and learning new technologies. My academic journey has helped me build a strong foundation in areas like data structures, algorithms, web development, and software engineering. I actively seek opportunities to apply my knowledge through hands-on projects, coding competitions, and collaboration with peers.

Outside the classroom, I enjoy exploring the latest tech trends, working on personal development, and staying connected with the developer community. Whether it's learning a new programming language, understanding how systems work, or developing apps that solve real-world problems—I’m always curious and eager to grow.

Looking ahead, I aspire to become a skilled software developer or tech innovator, contributing to projects that make a meaningful impact. I'm also open to internships and collaborative opportunities that allow me to learn, grow, and apply my skills in practical settings.
</i?</h3>
